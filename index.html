    <h2> When is downendMC online?</h2>
  </div>
  <p> DownendMC comes online every time a whitelisted player attempts to join. These whitelisted players are my few closest friends or server members. If you want a specific time for it to be online, feel free to request that from the owner of an Operator.</p>

    <h2> How do I join DownendMC?</h2>
  </div>
  <h3> For Minecraft: Java Edition</h3> <br>
  <p>Open Minecraft Java Edition, go into the multiplayer tab, press, "add server". There should be two places you can type. <br> For Server Name, put, "DownendMC". <br> For the IP/bottom input, put exactly this: "survival.downendmc.com" <br> When you want to play, you can simply press play like you would for any server.</p>
  <br> <br>
  <h3> For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (More difficult)</h3> <br>
  <p>Download "Bedrock Together" on your phone (~1M downloads), and open it. <br> In the IP: section type, "survival.downendmc.com" <br> In the Port: section type, "60672" <br> After this, press Add to favourite hen "Watch Ad and Run".
  <br> Open Minecraft and navigate to the Friends tab. Connect to the server using the LAN tab. Close BedrockTogether app after the client has joined the server. (Official Bedrock Together instructions)</p>
  <br>
  <p> Minecraft is introducing a new UI, where LAN servers are now located in the Worlds tab instead of the Friends tab. To view LAN servers, ensure that LAN server visibilty is turned ON. </p>
